# Pinia Store Implementation

This document outlines how we've integrated Pinia into the Vue.js project and restructured the application architecture to use it.

## What is Pinia?

Pinia is the official state management library for Vue.js applications. It provides a simple and type-safe way to share state between components.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  stores/               # Pinia stores directory
    index.ts            # Pinia configuration and exports
    index.d.ts          # Type definitions for stores
    auth.ts             # Auth store
    blog.ts             # Blog store
    plugins/
      localStorage.ts   # Persistence plugin for Pinia
```

## Store Modules

### Auth Store

The Auth store manages user authentication state including:
- User login/logout
- Token management and validation
- User profile information

### Blog Store

The Blog store manages blog content including:
- Fetching, creating, updating, and deleting blog posts
- Managing tags
- Handling post pagination

## Composables Integration

To maintain backward compatibility with the existing codebase, we've updated the composables to use the Pinia stores:

- `useAuth.ts` - Now wraps the Auth store functionality
- `useBlog.ts` - Now wraps the Blog store functionality

This approach allows for a gradual migration to Pinia without breaking existing component code.

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Centralized State Management**: All application state is now managed in one place
2. **Better TypeScript Support**: Full type safety across the application
3. **DevTools Integration**: Better debugging with Vue DevTools
4. **Persistence**: State is automatically persisted to localStorage
5. **Simplified Testing**: Easier to mock and test state in isolation
6. **Improved Performance**: Optimized reactivity with fine-grained control

## Next Steps

1. Update other components to use the Pinia stores directly if needed
2. Add more specialized stores for other features
3. Implement module-specific persistence options
4. Add state hydration for SSR (if applicable in the future)
